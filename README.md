# UnrealTournament CTF Heatmap

A heatmap plugin for Unreal Tournament (2015), based on MrTapa's original plugin.

How it works:
- Add M_HeatmapCTF mutator to your server
- Add this entire plugin to your UTEditor
- Get data from server (Heatmap file in root dir)
- Add data to UTEditor root folder & activate editor plugin


## 2025 update
Epic shut down UT's master servers, but the game (and editor!) are still available through UT4Ever: https://www.ut4ever.org/downloads

Special thanks to the UTCC & UT4Ever communties for making this project possible.
